Preamble  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

The Blood Chain General Public License (BCGPL)  
exists to ensure software remains free to use, but not free to exploit.  
It preserves the creator’s right to attribution, ethical distribution,  
and control over the cost and spirit of their work.  

This license is not affiliated with the GNU GPL and is not derived from it.  
It is an independent framework created to:  
Enforce ethical freedom through transparency, reciprocity, and integrity.  

If your work includes or derives from BCGPL software and accepts money—  
be it sales, subscriptions, or donations—your gain is shared.  
Blood split. Half to you, half to the origin.  
Visible, fair, inevitable.  

For clarity and mutual protection, Section 12 defines key terms used throughout this license.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  

1. Purpose and Scope  
   This license applies to the software it accompanies.  
   It grants freedoms and sets boundaries  
   so the work may remain free, ethical, and traceable.  

2. Permission to Use  
   Anyone may use this software without restriction, for personal, academic, artistic,  
   or commercial purposes, provided they do not violate the terms that follow.  

3. Modifying and Sharing  
   You may modify the software and distribute your version. If you do:  

* You must include this license text unmodified.  
* You must clearly document all changes.  
* You must follow Section 6 if you alter, remove or add any form of cost or pricing.  
* You may not relicense it under incompatible terms.  

4. Redistribution Conditions  
   Redistributed versions (whether modified or not) must remain under the BCGPL.  
   You may host, mirror, or share the software as long as these terms are preserved.  

5. Attribution and Credit  
   You must retain all original credits, author tags, and project identifiers in a visible location  
   (such as a README or About screen).  
   You may add your own credits, but not in a way that obscures the original.  

6. Cost Structure and Reciprocity  
   If the original software had a cost or donation model:  

* You must preserve that same structure in your fork, OR:  
* You must contribute an equivalent share of any revenue, donations, or monetary value gained  
  (direct or indirect) to the original author, OR:  
* You must clearly credit them and provide a visible link to their donation page.  

If your fork or derivative accepts donations or voluntary contributions:  

* You must visibly include the original author's donation link alongside your own.  
* You must split the total income derived from the software (voluntary or otherwise) 50/50,  
  unless a written agreement permits another ratio.  

If the fork or derivative is part of a larger project (e.g., a game or software suite),  

* The share owed shall be reasonably calculated based on the role and scope of the original code.  
* Attempts to obfuscate or fragment usage to reduce owed value are forbidden.  

Monetizing forks is permitted **only** when these terms are honored.  

7. Commercial Use  
   Commercial use is allowed, but must respect the attribution and cost rules.  
   You may not misrepresent the original author, nor imply endorsement.  

8. Evolution of This License  
   New versions of the BCGPL may be released to address new legal or technical issues.  
   Each version will have a distinct number and timestamp.  
   You may choose to follow any released version, unless a project explicitly locks to a specific one.  
   New versions will not add retroactive obligations to earlier adopters.  

9. No Warranty  
   This software is provided "as is," without any guarantees.  
   To the fullest extent allowed by law, the author disclaims all implied warranties,  
   including fitness for a particular purpose and merchantability.  

10. Limitation of Liability  
    In no event shall the author be liable for any damage resulting from the use,  
    mishandling, or failure of this software. Use it at your own risk.  

11. Interpretation  
    If any part of this license is deemed unenforceable by local law,  
    it shall be interpreted in the way that most closely honors its original intent.  

12. Definitions and Clarification  
    For avoidance of doubt and to ensure clarity:  

* "Blood" refers to any form of monetary value or gain derived from the software.  
* "Fork" means any modified, derivative, or extended version of the original software.  
* "Original author" refers to the copyright holder of the initial BCGPL-licensed work.  
* "Visible" means plainly shown on relevant public-facing pages, UI, or documentation.  
* "Fair split" means a 50/50 division unless explicitly renegotiated and agreed to.  
* "Cost structure" includes pricing, donation models, access gating, or paid features.  
* "300AB // Jamie" shall be considered a valid legal attribution identifier under this license.
